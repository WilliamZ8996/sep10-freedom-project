            <h2>Introduction to Dentistry</h2>
             <p>When was the last time you went to your dentist to get your teeth checked? Most people find it boring to visit the dentist since what you mostly do there is stare at a light with your mouth wide open. This website will show you the field of dentistry more closely and make you realize how actually important it is for us. To start things off, dentistry is the treatment of diseases or conditions that affects your teeth and gum. Dentistry can be dated back all the way to 7000 B.C. within the Indus Valley Civilization. Since it was really back then, the technology and tools that were used for dentistry wasn't the best nor effective. As time passes and technology gets more advance, the tools and technologies used for dentistry also got more precise and advanced. Nowadays we brush our teeth everyday in order to keep us healthy and clean, but it's also important to get checked professionally by a dentist.</p>
           <h2>Importance of Dentistry</h2>
            <p>We use our mouth and teeth every single day for eating, talking, etc, but how much time do we actually spend a day taking care or thinking about them. It is really hard for us to look into our own mouths and find the cavities or diseases that have been living there for a couple of months or so. Just imagine how much diseases and cavities that are in our teeth and we don't even realize. But thanks to dentistry, it allowed us to take good care of our teeth and fix the different kinds of problems in our teeth. Dentists help us by finding the diseases and cavities that are existing in our teeth and help us cure them before they get worse. They can even help us clean our teeth properly to prevent such problems from even existing. Not just helping us cure oral diseases, they can even help improve our appearances. Fixing the alignments of our teeth is also part of a dentist’s job. </p>

           <h2>Dentistry Technologies</h2>
            <p>There are many different dentistry technologies that are used everyday. Some you might have seen when you last visit a dentist, some of them you might not even know of. Below will include most of the technologies that had been used in dentistry and might even been used on you!</p>

           <h2>Possible Future Technologies</h2>
            <p>Both dentistry and technologies will get more and more advanced in the upcoming years, but at the moment there are technologies that haven't been created that would be helpful and the benficial for the field of dentistry. Below includes a few of the possible future technologies and their purpose that I had come up with which I think would be beneficial.</p>
           <h3>Teeth Age Scanners</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li>Being able to scan all the teeth of a patient and give the ages of the teeth</li>
                <li>Being able to estimate the number of years the teeth has before it becomes weak or come off</li>
                <li>Being able to see potential growing cavities within teeth</li>
                <li>This is a technology that can be really helpful in the future. Dentists can use this to estimate the ages of the teeth, which allows them to warn elders. This gives elders and dentists time to prepare for implants or surgeries. Dentists can also use this to scan for potential growing cavities, they can warn their patients before it gets worse. By knowing in advance, they can help prevent it from getting worse.
   </li>
            </ul>
           <h3>Teeth Cleaner Machine</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li>Being able to clean a patient’s teeth</li>
                <li>Being able to be controlled by a dentist from a distance</li>
                <li>Allowing precise brushing and flossing to be done with the help of technology</li>
                <li>This is a technology that can be really helpful in the future since it can be more precise than human work. The teeth cleaner machine can be connected to a scanner that can help it scan exactly where the teeth might need more cleaning and treatments. It is hard to see exact spots or germs on a microscopic level, so this technology can make it easier for dentists to see and be able to treat them at the same time. The ability to control the machine from a distance can be helpful in times like a pandemic to practice social distancing, or even working from home.</li>
            </ul>
           <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>As much as we appreciate all the delicious foods out there in the world, we should also take a moment every now and then to appreciate our teeth. Without our teeth, we can’t even enjoy all these foods every day or even talk with our friends. Our teeth play such important roles in our lives every day without us even realizing it, so we should really learn to take care of them and thank dentistry for helping us when it comes to caring for our teeth. I hope the information here can help you smile brighter every day.</p>
